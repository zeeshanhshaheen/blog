My name is Thomas Desmond and I am a Technical Evangelist and former Senior Software Engineer. I enjoy writing code myself and find even more joy in helping others succeed in code as well. I have this blog to share my thoughts and things I learn day to day while programming. A few personal articles make it in as well so I can remember some of my favorite camping trips.

Over the past few years, my “hobbies” have been speaking at conferences, creating technical video course content, and maintaining this blog. I was also a University Instructor for 3 years creating my own curriculum in mobile programming.

Let’s take a look at some of the work I have done.
