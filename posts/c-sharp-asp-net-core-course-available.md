In June of this year, I began working on my first ever online technical course. It just got published! Check out my course published on Thinkster.io: [Creating a C# ASP.Net Core API](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/creating-a-c-asp-net-core-api-introduction). I put in a ton of hard work to create the course and hope others can learn from it and enjoy it.

The course covers how to make your own API with C# using ASP.Net Core. It starts with the basics covering the GET, POST, PUT, & DELETE HTTP methods and expands into the more advanced cases. You will also learn about status codes, error handling & C# best practices.

The course provides you with the skeleton code for a space-themed API and contains four different exercises to reinforce and test your learning. By the end of the course, you will have your own fully functioning space-themed API written in C# using ASP.Net Core.

Basic knowledge of C# and the desire to learn is all you need to be successful in the course.

Brooke Avery and Joe Eames deserve a big THANK YOU for the support and help in developing this course. Expect more courses in the future. I think my next one will be on LINQ!
